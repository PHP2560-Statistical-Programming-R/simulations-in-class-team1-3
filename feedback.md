Great job! Please add some comments to your code and your results.

For the Problem1, Problem2 and Problem3, it would be better to write a function to simulate.

For problem4, the **boot_ci** function would be better to take the estimating function as input.

Great job! Please add some comments to your code and your results.

For problem4, please write a function **boot_ci** to fulfill all the steps. The function needs to take the dataset and the estimating function as input.
